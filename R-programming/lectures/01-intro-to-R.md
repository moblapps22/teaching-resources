## Unit I: Exception Handling and PHP Filters

- **Learning Outcomes (CLO01)**  
  - Identify the need for exception handling in PHP.  
  - Demonstrate the use of `try`, `throw`, `catch`, and `finally`.  
  - Create and use custom exception classes.  
  - Handle multiple exceptions with multiple `catch` blocks.  
  - Demonstrate the use of PHP filters for validation and sanitization.  

- **Key Concepts**:  
  - Exception = unexpected event disrupting normal flow.  
  - Analogy: Like a *fire alarm* interrupting normal operations.  
  - Example: Division by zero, File not found, Database connection failure.

## Unit II: Working with File and Directories + Regular Expressions

- **Learning Outcomes (CLO02)**  
  - Apply techniques to open, read, write, copy, rename, and delete files.  
  - Demonstrate safe uploading and downloading of files in PHP.  
  - Retrieve metadata such as file size and last-modified time.  
  - Utilize regular expressions for string matching, replacing, and splitting.  

- **Key Concepts**:  
  - File operations: open/close, copy, rename, delete.  
  - Directory operations and file information retrieval.  
  - Regex basics: patterns, matching, splitting, and replacing text.

## Unit III: Cookies, Sessions, and PHP Email Function

- **Learning Outcomes (CLO03)**  
  - Implement cookies for storing, retrieving, and deleting small pieces of data.  
  - Apply session management for user authentication and personalization.  
  - Demonstrate secure logout and session regeneration techniques.  
  - Send email using PHP with headers, protocols, and proper formatting.  

- **Key Concepts**:  
  - Cookies vs. Sessions: client-side vs. server-side storage.

- **Learning Outcomes (CLO04)**  
  - Explain the features of Ajax and how it interacts with PHP.  
  - Apply Ajax to submit and retrieve data asynchronously.  
  - Demonstrate the use of jQuery selectors, attributes, and events.  
  - Use jQuery functions to manipulate DOM dynamically.  

- **Key Concepts**:  
  - Ajax = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.  
  - Request → Response cycle with PHP.  
  - jQuery: simplified JavaScript for DOM traversal, event handling, and animation.

- **Learning Outcomes (CLO05)**  
  - Integrate PHP forms with MySQL database using sessions.  
  - Retrieve data dynamically with Ajax requests.  
  - Implement jQuery with Ajax and PHP for interactive applications.  
  - Analyze data-driven applications with filters, pagination, and export options.
